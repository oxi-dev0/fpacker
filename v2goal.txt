1. Benchmark v1.1.1
2. Rewrite completely with new knowledge of binary manipulation, memory management etc
3. Rewrite API to be more intuitive
4. Benchmark new version and compare
5. Release

Major Issues with old version:
section lengths are stored in utf-8 representations of the numbers (what???)
using std::vector to store binary sequence (again, what???)
writing unpacked files byte by byte (whyyyy)

All of these issues are slow work arounds to things i didnt understand how to fix, but now i have practised with other projects and know what to do.

Todo for rewrite:
write actual binary numbers rather than strings
use blocks of heap to assemble data and single write to packfile
write entire data to unpacked files in one call
Should see massive improvement in perf
