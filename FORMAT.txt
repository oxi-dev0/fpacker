Binary Format:
[MagicNumber][VersionCode][Config][Data]
	[MagicNumber] = 0x465041434B4552 (FPACKER)
	[VersionCode] = Ma:Mi:Pa where Ma, Mi and Pa are the version number integers represented with one byte each
	[Config] = [bool (encrypted)][VolumeCount][Volumes]
		[VolumeCount] = int, 8 bytes, # volumes (0 if this is the only volume)
		[Volumes] = (repeated)[VolumeNameSize][VolumeName]
			[VolumeNameSize] = int, 8 bytes, length of name in characters
			[VolumeName] = sequence of unicode chars (2 bytes per char)

	[Data] = (potentially encrypted)[TreeSize][FileTree][CRC]
		[TreeSize] = int, 8 bytes, length of tree in bytes
		[FileTree] = (repeated)[DirNameSize][DirName][FileCount][Files][TreeCount][Trees]
			[DirNameSize] = int, 8 bytes, length of dir name in characters
			[DirName] = sequence of unicode chars (2 bytes per char), name relative to parent tree
			[FileCount] = int, 8 bytes, number of files
			[Files] = (repeated)[FileLength][File]
				[FileLength] = int, 8 bytes, size of file in bytes
				[File] = byte sequence for file
			[TreeCount] = int, 8 bytes, number of sub trees
			[Trees] = (repeated)[TreeSize][FileTree]
		[CRC] = 

Functionality:
MagicNumber is used to verify file is a package
VersionCode is used to verify the compatibility of the package
Config specifies metadata about the package

If the package is encrypted, the key is verified before extraction by checking the CRC of the decrypted TreeSize bytes against the decrypted CRC
